# WindSightAI

WindSightAI is an advanced wind turbine blade inspection system that leverages artificial intelligence and computer vision techniques to detect and classify defects on wind turbine blades. This project aims to improve the efficiency and accuracy of wind turbine maintenance, ultimately contributing to the optimization of renewable energy production.

## Features

- AI-powered defect detection on wind turbine blades
- Real-time analysis of drone-captured images
- Interactive dashboard for visualizing inspection results
- Training pipeline for custom defect detection models
- Comprehensive data analysis and reporting tools

## Future Work

We are continuously working to enhance WindSightAI's capabilities. Our upcoming developments include:

- **Anomaly Detection Models**: We plan to integrate advanced anomaly detection algorithms to identify unusual patterns or defects that may not be captured by traditional classification methods. This will allow for more robust and comprehensive defect detection, potentially uncovering issues before they become critical.

- **Predictive Maintenance**: By combining our defect detection capabilities with historical data and machine learning, we aim to predict potential failures and optimize maintenance schedules.

- **3D Reconstruction**: We're exploring the use of multiple drone images to create 3D models of wind turbine blades, allowing for more detailed and accurate defect analysis.

- **Integration with IoT Sensors**: Future versions will incorporate data from IoT sensors on the turbines to provide a more holistic view of turbine health and performance.

Stay tuned for these exciting enhancements that will further revolutionize wind turbine maintenance!
